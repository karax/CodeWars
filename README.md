   [CodeWars](https://www.codewars.com/) is a community for developers and those who wants to learn computer programming. Its platform offers a plenty of challenges from beginner to advanced level. To motivate the users to do the challenges, it uses gamification ranking the users with most complete challenges, creating guilds of users to compete with another guilds, etc.
   
   I created CodeWars Users Rank in order to train my Kotlin skills with new technologies that are being launched by google, such as Navigation Actions and Hilt, and also implement already known concepts such as TDD, SOLID and MVVM.
   
   The app uses CodeWars public APIs to retrieve the userâ€™s information (such as challenges list) and list the searched users by its rank or by time of look up. 


Ps. As it uses lattest gradlle version, you need to run it using Android Studio 4.0 version or higher
